# Datacraft
This is a data visualization tool done as a part of the internship assignment for [Interface Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/interface-ai-labs/). Merchants/traders can upload their payment data and the web app crunches the tables and data to provide meaningful numbers and visualizations.

## Getting Started
### Setting it up Locally

```
git clone https://github.com/helios2003/Datacraft.git
```

## Tech Stack
